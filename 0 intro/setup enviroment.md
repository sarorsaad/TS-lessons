npm init -y    # create a package.json file

npm install --save-dev typescript   # install typescript

npm install --save-dev ts-node ts-node-dev @types/node # install ts-node and ts-node-dev  

mkdir src    # create a src folder

Great! I've set up a basic TypeScript development environment for you. Here's what I've done:

Initialized a new Node.js project with package.json
Installed TypeScript and necessary development dependencies:
typescript: The TypeScript compiler
ts-node: For running TypeScript files directly
ts-node-dev: For development with auto-reload
@types/node: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js
Created a src directory with a basic index.ts file
Added useful npm scripts:
npm start: Runs your TypeScript code
npm run build: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run dev: Runs TypeScript in development mode with auto-reload
You can now start developing with TypeScript! Here's how to use it:

Write your TypeScript code in the src directory
Use npm run dev for development with auto-reload
Use npm run build when you want to compile to JavaScript
Use npm start to run your compiled code
